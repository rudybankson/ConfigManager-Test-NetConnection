# ConfigManager-Test-NetConnection

This script will let you test if a network connection is open on a specific port. The command Test-NetConnection is easy to run on its own, so this is more intended to be ran from Configuration Manager's Script library. If you run this fron Configuration Manager (right click Device, Run Script, pick this script, input parameters for host and port, click next) the results will come back with success or failure... easy to read.
